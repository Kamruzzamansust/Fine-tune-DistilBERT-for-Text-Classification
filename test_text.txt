  "text": "Before the Germany game the Scotland fans made it one of the best pre-match atmospheres I have ever witnessed. And then the game kicked off and it was such a sorry performance. Scotland were smothered completely, and were not allowed to play. They have to do much better against Switzerland. Scotland's first aim has got to be to get up the pitch, something they failed to do against Germany, but it won't be easy. The Swiss have started really well and Granit Xhaka was influential for them against Hungary. I said before the tournament that I thought Scotland have a Championship backline, and I am worried about that again here."
