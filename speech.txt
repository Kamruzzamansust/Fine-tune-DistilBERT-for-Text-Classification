Speech is the use of the human voice as a medium for language. 
Spoken language combines vowel and consonant sounds to form units of 
meaning like words, which belong to a language's lexicon. 
There are many different intentional speech acts, such as informing, 
declaring, asking, persuading, directing; acts may vary in various 
aspects like enunciation, intonation, loudness, and tempo to convey 
meaning. Individuals may also unintentionally communicate aspects of 
their social position through speech, such as sex, age, place of origin,
physiological and mental condition, education, and experiences.
